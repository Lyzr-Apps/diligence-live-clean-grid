- What is technician turnover rate and labor cost inflation trend?
- How dependent is business on key operational personnel?

Sustainability:
- Are accounting policy changes (depreciation, revenue recognition) justified?
- What is true sustainable EBITDA after normalizing for one-time items?
- How much of founder add-backs are truly discretionary?

Audit & Controls:
- Why only review-level (not audit-level) financial statements?
- What specific AR control weaknesses were noted in management letter?
- Have weaknesses been remediated?
- What is risk of additional client write-offs given 15% AR over 90 days?
